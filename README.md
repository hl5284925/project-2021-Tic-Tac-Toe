# Project---Tic-Tac-Toe


## How to play
It is played on a three-by-three grid by one player with computer player, who placing 🐵s and 🐸s on the board until either player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally or until all squares on the grid are filled. If a player is able to draw three 🐵s or three 🐸s in a row, then that player wins. If all squares are filled and neither player has made a complete row of 🐵s or 🐸s, then the game is a draw
